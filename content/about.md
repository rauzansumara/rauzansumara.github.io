Academic Project Undertaken
---------------------------

**Project 3 :** Non-Clickbait Detector Apps; **October to December 2018**

: This is the final project of big data & artificial intelligence training scholarship provided by Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesia (KOMINFO). Purpose of it is to create android apps in order to detect non clickbait news in the internet. For classifying, my team and I developed semi-supervised learning algorithm in Python. The application can be downloaded in google store named “kliken”. Video here [*here*](https://youtu.be/EPvXapaZoAk).


**Project 2 :** Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Modeling; **April to June 2016**

: This project is the final exam of Fuzzy Logic Course. Purpose of it is to create functions (coding) on R based on stages and theory of takagi sugeno fuzzy modeling. The model can be used to predict time series data. Furthermore, for testing of the functions, I used Rupiah Exchange Rate data and predicted them.


**Project 1 :** GUI for Statistical Distribution; **April to June 2016**

: This project is the final exam of Advanced Computational Statistics Course. Purpose of it is to create a Grafical User Interface (GUI) about simple statistical distribution on R. Two distributions were made, 1). Discrete distributions consist of binomial, poisson, geometric, and negative binomial distribution. 2). Continuous distributions consist of normal Z, Student t, Chi Sqaure, and Fisher distribution. Through the GUI we can easily show probability, quantile, plotting, generating data and others.
