## Academic Project Undertaken


**Project 15 :** Comparison of Automated COVID-19 Detection using CNNs on Chest CT Images; **January 2023**

: This was the final project from the Computer Vision course. Please check here to [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/computer-vision)


**Project 14 :** Experiments on DBSCAN and DBSCANRN with Tanimoto Similarity; **October 2022**

: This was the final project from the introduction to machine learning course. Clustering is one of the most important tasks of both artificial intelligence and data mining. There are different approaches and algorithms to perform clustering tasks in which one is of them is algorithms based on density clustering. We will implement algorithms of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Density-based spatial clustering using reverse nearest neighbors (DBSCRN). However, noted during project consultations, there are some inconsistencies in the paper presenting the pseudo-code of the DBSCRN algorithm [1]. For this reason, we will implement some modification of DBSCRN (which will be called DBSCANRN) instead of DBSCRN [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/dbscan-and-dbscanrn-tanimoto-similarity)


**Project 13 :** A Dynamical System using Swallowtail Catastrophe Model; **October 2022**

: This was the final project from the Introduction to Singularity Theory course. A dynamical system can be defined as a set of interacting variables with properties of continuity, determination, and infinite duration. The mechanisms of a dynamical system include: bifurcations, transformation of a system from one type to another. Bifurcation theory, as proposed by [1], was further developed through the application of the work of mathematician Rene Thom. [2] provided the complete proof for the existence of seven elementary catastrophes, which he termed, in order of complexity, the fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, elliptic umbilic, hyperbolic umbilic, and parabolic umbilic. Catastrophe theory is derived from topology, a field of mathematics that studies the properties of surfaces in numerous dimensions. [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/swallowtail-catastrophe-modeling)


**Project 12 :** Face Mask Detection with MobileNetV2; **January 2022**

: This was the tutorial project for students in the Introduction to Machine Mearning course. This report is trying to create a robust face mask detection based on convolution neural network. In order to detect a face mask, we implement the object detection algorithm which is MobileNetV2 architecture. The rest of this report will be organized as follows: section two illustrates the datasets. Section three describes the face mask detection algorithm and section four presents the experimental results in real-time data [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/face-mask-detection-based-on-mobilenetv2)


**Project 11 :** ARIMA with Intervention Model for Predicting Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Malang City, Indonesia; **February 2021**

: This was the final project from the Theory of Forecasting and Simulation course. The project aimed to model the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Malang City. We observed series from January 2006 to June 2017. Because there are interventions that occurred in June 2008 (Intervention I) and January 2014 (Intervention II), the change of the reference basis for calculating the CPI, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with Intervention will be used, then the best model was performed for predicting the CPI for the next 12 months [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/myproject)


**Project 10 :** Implementation of GAN and cGAN Models; **January 2021**

: As the final project of Deep Learning in Python Course, I was trying to detail what Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) are. I also explain and give an implementation of both of them separately. Code also can be obtained from my [Github](https://github.com/rauzansumara/gan-and-cgan). Those models are the most exciting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator (**the artist**) learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator (**the art critic**) learns to tell real images apart from fakes [*Read More…*](https://rauzansumara.github.io/posts/implementation-of-gan-and-cgan/).


**Project 9 :** Predict Churning Customers; **January 2021**

: This was my final project of Data Mining Course; the dataset and Python code can be downloaded on my [Github](https://github.com/rauzansumara/predict-churning-customers). A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate it if one could predict who is going to get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction. This dataset is original from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers). The dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are nearly 18 features. From this data set, we can predict the customers who are going to stop using credit cards and can make an offer to customers to retain them [*Read More…*](https://rauzansumara.github.io/posts/predict-churning-customers/).


**Project 8 :** Social Network Analysis Using Gephi; **June 2020**

: In this project, I tried to track tweets related to covid-19, what accounts were mostly and actively talking about the coronavirus, and how to structure relationships that connect individuals or behaviors of social relations. The dataset for this social network analysis was taken from Twitter using the crawling feature in R Studio. I used Twitter data mainly related to @WHO and #COVID19 tweets in the USA [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/myproject).


**Project 7 :** Build CNN Model to Classify Images of Drill Holes; **April 2020**

: This project presents a deep learning approach to drilling condition assessment. The assessment regarding the level of the drill wear was done on the basis of the drilled hole images. To prepare images for recognizing the drill condition, the elimination of the artifacts (unnecessary part of images around hole) was done first. Moreover, every image was cropped to 170x170 pixels, and conversion from RGB to grayscale has been applied. Such prepared images were used directly as the input data in deep learning. We have applied size of the receptive field to equals 5x5 pixels and 32 filters in the layer, set the stride size equal to one in the convolutional layer and the value of two in the pooling layer. It consists of successive three convolution ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit) layers, followed by the pooling layers for feature learning and the fully connected softmax used as a classifier [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/myproject).


**Project 6 :** QR Code Generator and Scanner Mobile Apps; **October to January 2020**

: This is an android apps that is not only to describe and maintain the information about equipment. It also helps the user manage all the equipment already provided in school by specific features of the given software. The purpose of the application is to help the staff to define the equipment just by scan it on the smartphone. The application was designed to make good management in the inventory at a school. This application can be installed on a mobile phone, specifically in an android application [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/myproject).


**Project 5 :** Non-Clickbait Detector Apps; **October to December 2018**

: This was the final project of big data & artificial intelligence training scholarship provided by Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesia (KOMINFO). The purpose was to create android apps in order to detect non-clickbait news on the internet. For classifying, my team and I developed a semi-supervised learning algorithm in Python. The application can be downloaded in the google store named “kliken - Aplikasi Berita” [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/kliken-android-apps). 


**Project 4 :** Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Modeling; **April to June 2016**

: This project was a part of the final exam of Fuzzy Logic Course. The aim was to create functions (coding) on R based on stages and theory of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy modeling. This technique can be used to predict time series data [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/myproject).


**Project 3 :** GUI for Statistical Distribution; **April to June 2016**

: In completing the final exam of Advanced Computational Statistics Course, I created a Graphical User Interface (GUI), The simple statistical distributions in R. Two distributions were made, 1). Discrete distributions consist of binomial, Poisson, geometric, and negative binomial distribution. 2). Continuous distributions consist of normal Z, Student t, Chi-Square, and Fisher distribution. Through the GUI, we can easily show probability, quantile, plotting, and generating data [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/myproject).


**Project 2 :** Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) and Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) Model in Empirical Finance; **May 2016**

: We aim to study non-linearities in the quarterly Indonesia Interest Rates (1958-1970) by means of threshold autoregressive and smooth transition autoregressive models. There are two beneficial forms of the STAR model: the Logistic STAR and the Exponential STAR. We compared these models, AR, TAR, Logistic STAR, and Exponential STAR, based on AIC criteria. The result showed there was some non-linear structure to be modeled, and STAR adequately describes in-sample movements of interest rates. The Logistic STAR was performing better than other models. The model allows the autoregressive parameters to change slowly, and in general, the STAR family of models is a suitable tool in explaining some extreme events [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/myproject).


**Project 1 :** The Application of Error Correction Model (ECM) in Handling Spurious Regression; **April 2016**

: Time series data consist of dividends and profits quarterly from 1970 to 1991 was given. There is a positive correlation between those two variables. After performing the regression model, which is dividends as dependent and profits as the independent variable, It was proven that spurious regression was present so that we identified cointegration by using the Engle-Granger test. In handling long-run stochastic trends (cointegration), ECM was applied. ECM is a theoretically-driven approach useful for estimating both short-term and long-term effects of one-time series on another [*Read More…*](https://github.com/rauzansumara/myproject).
