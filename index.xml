      <description>Here we are going to talk into the detail of how to improve Siamese Network Using Gabor Filter. I will also explain and give a comparison of Siamese Network without and with Gabor Filter seperately. Full code also can be obtained from my GitHub.
Siamese Network    In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are almost good at every task, but these CNNs rely on more data to perform well.</description>

      <description>Here we are going to talk into the detail of what Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) are. I will also explain and give an implementation both of them seperately. Code also can be obtained from my GitHub. This model is one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator (&amp;ldquo;the artist&amp;rdquo;) learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator (&amp;ldquo;the art critic&amp;rdquo;) learns to tell real images apart from fakes.</description>

      <description>Final Project of Data Mining Course - Big Data Analysis    This is my final project of Data Mining Course, dataset and Python code can be downloaded in my Github
A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers&#39; decisions in the opposite direction</description>

      <description>Introduction    This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>I finished my bachelor of science in the department of statistics, Brawijaya University in Indonesia. I currently study for my masterâ€™s degree at Warsaw University of Life Sciences in Computer Science &amp;amp; Econometrics: specialization in big data analytics, Poland. My research is focused on Bayesian inference and time series analysis; meanwhile, I am also interested in big data analytics and machine learning. I am used to doing for a living as a freelance data analyst.</description>
