      <description>Here we are going to talk into the detail of what Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) are. I will also explain and give an implementation both of them seperately. Code also can be obtained from my GitHub. This model is one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator (&amp;ldquo;the artist&amp;rdquo;) learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator (&amp;ldquo;the art critic&amp;rdquo;) learns to tell real images apart from fakes.</description>
