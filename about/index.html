<dt><strong>Project 11 :</strong> ARIMA with Intervention Model for Predicting Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Malang City, Indonesia; <strong>February 2021</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This was the final project from the Theory of Forecasting and Simulation course—the project aimed to model the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Malang City. We observed series from January 2006 to June 2017. Because there are interventions that occurred in June 2008 (Intervention I) and January 2014 (Intervention II), the change of the reference basis for calculating the CPI, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with Intervention will be used, then the best model was performed for predicting the CPI for the next 12 months.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 10 :</strong> Implementation of GAN and cGAN Models; <strong>January 2021</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>As the final project of Deep Learning in Python Course, I was trying to detail what Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) are. I also explain and give an implementation of both of them separately. Code also can be obtained from my <a href="https://github.com/rauzansumara/gan-and-cgan">Github</a>. Those models are the most exciting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator (<strong>the artist</strong>) learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator (<strong>the art critic</strong>) learns to tell real images apart from fakes. Thanks so much to <a href="https://github.com/rauzansumara/gan-and-cgan">Rowel Atienza</a>, <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-conditional-generative-adversarial-network-from-scratch/">Jason Brownlee</a> and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan">www.tensorflow.org</a> that inspired me from their articles.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 9 :</strong> Predict Churning Customers; <strong>January 2021</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This was my final project of Data Mining Course; the dataset and Python code can be downloaded on my <a href="https://github.com/rauzansumara/predict-churning-customers">Github</a>. A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate it if one could predict who is going to get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction. This dataset is original from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers">Kaggle</a>. The dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are nearly 18 features. From this data set, we can predict the customers who are going to stop using credit cards and can make an offer to customers to retain them.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 8 :</strong> Social Network Analysis Using Gephi; <strong>June 2020</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this project, I have tried to track tweets related to covid-19, what accounts were mostly and actively talking about the coronavirus, and how to structure relationships that connect individuals or behaviors of social relations. The dataset for this social network analysis is taken from Twitter using the crawling feature in R Studio. I used Twitter data mainly related to @WHO and #COVID19 tweets in the USA.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 7 :</strong> Build CNN Model to Classify Images of Drill Holes; <strong>April 2020</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This project presents a deep learning approach to drilling condition assessment. The assessment regarding the level of the drill wear was done on the basis of the drilled hole images. To prepare images for recognizing the drill condition, the elimination of the artifacts (unnecessary part of images around hole) was done first. Moreover, every image was cropped to 170x170 pixels, and conversion from RGB to grayscale has been applied. Such prepared images were used directly as the input data in deep learning. We have applied size of the receptive field to equals 5x5 pixels and 32 filters in the layer, set the stride size equal to one in the convolutional layer and the value of two in the pooling layer. It consists of successive three convolution ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit) layers, followed by the pooling layers for feature learning and the fully connected softmax used as a classifier.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 6 :</strong> QR Code Generator and Scanner Mobile Apps; <strong>October to January 2020</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is an application that is not only to describe and maintain the information about equipment. It also helps the user manage all the equipment already provided in school by specific features of the given software. The purpose of the application is to help the staff to define the equipment just by scan it on the smartphone. The application was designed to make good management in the inventory at a school. This application can be installed on a mobile phone, specifically in an android application.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 5 :</strong> Non-Clickbait Detector Apps; <strong>October to December 2018</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the final project of big data &amp; artificial intelligence training scholarship provided by Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesia (KOMINFO). The purpose is to create android apps in order to detect non-clickbait news on the internet. For classifying, my team and I developed a semi-supervised learning algorithm in Python. The application can be downloaded in the google store named “kliken - Aplikasi Berita”.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 4 :</strong> Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Modeling; <strong>April to June 2016</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This project is a part of the final exam of Fuzzy Logic Course. The aim is to create functions (coding) on R based on stages and theory of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy modeling. The model can be used to predict time series data. Furthermore, for testing of the functions, I used Rupiah Exchange Rate data and predicted them.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 3 :</strong> GUI for Statistical Distribution; <strong>April to June 2016</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In completing the final exam of Advanced Computational Statistics Course, I created a Graphical User Interface (GUI) about simple statistical distribution in R. Two distributions were made, 1). Discrete distributions consist of binomial, Poisson, geometric, and negative binomial distribution. 2). Continuous distributions consist of normal Z, Student t, Chi-Square, and Fisher distribution. Through the GUI, we can easily show probability, quantile, plotting, and generating data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 2 :</strong> Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) and Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) Model in Empirical Finance; <strong>May 2016</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>We aim to study non-linearities in the quarterly Indonesia Interest Rates (1958-1970) by means of threshold autoregressive and smooth transition autoregressive models. There are two beneficial forms of the STAR model: the Logistic STAR and the Exponential STAR. We compared these models, AR, TAR, Logistic STAR, and Exponential STAR, based on AIC criteria. The result showed there was some non-linear structure to be modeled, and STAR adequately describes in-sample movements of interest rates. The Logistic STAR was performing better than other models. The model allows the autoregressive parameters to change slowly, and in general, the STAR family of models is a suitable tool in explaining some extreme events.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 1 :</strong> The Application of Error Correction Model (ECM) in Handling Spurious Regression; <strong>April 2016</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Time series data consist of dividends and profits quarterly from 1970 to 1991 was given. There is a positive correlation between those two variables. After performing the regression model, which is dividends as dependent and profits as the independent variable, It was proven that spurious regression was present as well as cointegration by using the Engle-Granger test. In handling long-run stochastic trends (cointegration), ECM was applied. ECM is a theoretically-driven approach useful for estimating both short-term and long-term effects of one-time series on another.</p>
