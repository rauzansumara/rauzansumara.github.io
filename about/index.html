<dl>
<dt><strong>Project 8 :</strong> Social Network Analysis Using Gephi; <strong>June 2020</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this project, I have tried to track tweets related to covid-19, what accounts were mostly and actively talking about the coronavirus, and how structure relationships that connect individuals or behaviors of social relations. The dataset for this social network analysis is taken from Twitter using crawling feature in R Studio. I used Twitter data particularly related to @WHO and #COVID19 tweets in USA.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 7 :</strong> Build CNN Model to Classify Images of Drill Holes; <strong>April 2020</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This paper presents deep learning approach to drill condition assessment. The assessment regarding level of the drill wear is done on the basis of the drilled hole images. To prepare images for recognition of the drill condition the elimination of the artifacts (unnecessary part of images around hole) was done first. Moreover every image was cropped to 170x170 pixels and conversion from RGB to grayscale has been applied. Such prepared images were used directly as the input data in deep learning. We have applied size of the receptive field equals 5x5 pixels and 32 filters in the layer. We have applied the stride size equal one in convolutional layer and value of two in pooling layer. It consists of successive 3 convolution ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit) layers, followed by the pooling layers for feature learning and the fully connected softmax used as a classifier.</p>

<dt><strong>Project 6 :</strong> QR Code Generator and Scanner Mobile Apps; <strong>October to January 2020</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is an application which is not only to describe and maintain the information about equipment and it also helps the user to manage all the equipment that already provided in school easily by specific feature of the given software. The purpose of the application is to help the staff to define the equipment just by scan it on the smartphone. The application is designed to make good management in the inventory at a school. This application can be installed on mobile phone specifically in android application.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 5 :</strong> Non-Clickbait Detector Apps; <strong>October to December 2018</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the final project of big data &amp; artificial intelligence training scholarship provided by Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesia (KOMINFO). Purpose of it is to create android apps in order to detect non clickbait news in the internet. For classifying, my team and I developed semi-supervised learning algorithm in Python. The application can be downloaded in google store named “kliken - Aplikasi Berita”.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 4 :</strong> Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Modeling; <strong>April to June 2016</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This project is a part of the final exam of Fuzzy Logic Course. The aim is to create functions (coding) on R based on stages and theory of takagi-sugeno fuzzy modeling. The model can be used to predict time series data. Furthermore, for testing of the functions, I used Rupiah Exchange Rate data and predicted them.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 3 :</strong> GUI for Statistical Distribution; <strong>April to June 2016</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In completing the final exam of Advanced Computational Statistics Course, I created a Graphical User Interface (GUI) about simple statistical distribution in R. Two distributions were made, 1). Discrete distributions consist of binomial, poisson, geometric, and negative binomial distribution. 2). Continuous distributions consist of normal Z, Student t, Chi Square, and Fisher distribution. Through the GUI we can easily show probability, quantile, plotting, and generating data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 2 :</strong> Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) and Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) Model in Empirical Finance; <strong>May 2016</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>We aim to study non-linearities in the quarterly Indonesia Interest Rates (1958-1970) by means of threshold autoregressive and smooth transition autoregressive models. There are two particularly useful forms of the STAR model: the Logistic STAR and the Exponential STAR. We compared these model, AR, TAR, Logistic STAR, and Exponential STAR, based on AIC criteria. The result showed there was some non-linear structure to be modeled and STAR adequately describe in-sample movements of interest rates. The Logistic STAR was performing better than other models. The model allow the autoregressive parameters to change slowly, and in general, the STAR family of models is a suitable tool in explaining some extreme events.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Project 1 :</strong> The Application of Error Correction Model (ECM) in Handling Spurious Regression; <strong>April 2016</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Time series data consist of dividends and profits quarterly from 1970 to 1991 was given. There is positive correlation between those two variables. After performing regression model which is dividends as dependent and profits as independent variable, It was proven that spurious regression was present as well as cointegration by using Engle-Granger test. In handling long-run stochastic trend (cointegration), ECM was applied. ECM is a theoretically-driven approach useful for estimating both short-term and long-term effects of one time series on another.</p>
