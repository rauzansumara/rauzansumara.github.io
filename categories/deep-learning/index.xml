      <description>Here we are going to talk into the detail of how to improve Siamese Network Using Gabor Filter. I will also explain and give a comparison of Siamese Network without and with Gabor Filter seperately. Full code also can be obtained from my GitHub.
Siamese Network    In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are almost good at every task, but these CNNs rely on more data to perform well.</description>

      <description>Here we are going to talk into the detail of what Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) are. I will also explain and give an implementation both of them seperately. Code also can be obtained from my GitHub. This model is one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator (&amp;ldquo;the artist&amp;rdquo;) learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator (&amp;ldquo;the art critic&amp;rdquo;) learns to tell real images apart from fakes.</description>
